This is Hood, a Mobile Enhancer addon that adds quickly accessible panel allowing
to turn on/off WiFi, GPRS and so on (similar to SBSettings, but much more lightweight).
It also can view the list of processes and kill them. Note that this was not tested on
modern iOS firmware versions or newer Xcode versions, so use at your own risk. It should
be fairly easy to make this a MobileSubstrate module, if someone wants to take this task.

You are free to clone, fork, or pick up and carry this on, if you'd like.
